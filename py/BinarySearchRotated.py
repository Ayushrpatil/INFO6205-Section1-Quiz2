    Perform binary search on a rotated sorted array.
    
    A rotated sorted array is an array that was initially sorted in ascending order
    but then rotated at a certain pivot index.
    
    Example:
    Original sorted array: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    Rotated at index 4: [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
    Here, the rotation index 4 means that the first four elements were moved to the end.
    
    :param arr: List[int] - The rotated sorted array.
    :param target: int - The number to search for.
    :param rotation_index: int - The index at which the array was rotated.
    :return: bool - True if the target is in the array, False otherwise.

    # Hint: While the entire array is not sorted, can it be viewed as 2 arrays which are sorted by themselves?
    
    return False  # TODO: Replace this with actual return value
